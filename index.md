# Omniwheel Robot
The omni wheel robot can not only work like a normal car, but also features unique wheels that have individual wheels on them that allow the robot to shift in different directions based on which individual wheel is spinning. In addition, the robot features a hand gesture mode that can be uses IR infared sensors to detect objects and shift the robot left, right and backwards. The robot also features a bluetooth module which allows it to be connected to a phone, which can be used to remotely control the robot. The robot also features a object avoidance and line following mode, which utilizes its sensors and limit switches.

For my first milestone, I completed the omni wheel robot as it came out of the box. Throughout the process of building, I learned more about the specific parts and their purposes as well as how each part interacted with each other. For example, while using the object avoidance mode, the IR sensors can detect an object in front of it and as a response, is able to trigger the motors, which spin in a certain way to avoid the obstacle. In comparison, the crash sensors detect whether something is pushing against its button, activating it. I also learned how the robot itself moves. Since the wheels on the robot dont change orientation like a traditional car, each wheel has its own miniature wheels that assist the robot to turn and shift based on which motors are spinning and how fast they are spinning. This means that the robot is able to shift in presice directions and not just left and right. The main challenges i faced was understanding the wiring and how to manage all of it. I overcame this issue by paying attention to the labelled pins on the wire and the board. Despite the robot being a part of a kit, it gave me a good platform to build on in the future, which i plan to add various LEDS as headlights and tailights, which I want to connect and control from a seperate arduino, as well as 3D print various parts such as a cover for the second arduino, which i plan to fit on top of the robot.

My starter project was a soldering exercise that features 3 sliders that control the red, green, and blue on the LED that is also attatched to the system. The can be connected via USB to a computer to be powered and controlled. A challenge that i faced while building was the polarity of the LED. At the time, I forgot to pay attention to the orientation of the LED, which led to LED colors to be reversed. However, this was a simple fix as it only required some de-soldering.

<!---# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
